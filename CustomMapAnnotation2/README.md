# Places Prototype 2: Custom Map Annotation
This is a second Custom Map Annotation prototype used to isolate, build and test the custom annotations used in the Places App. It isolates the custom annotation by placing in a simple app container with a ViewController containing a MapView with a single annotation at Grand Central Terminal.
